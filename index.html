You probably are aware that the fourth industrial revolution is well underway and accelerating rapidly. The speed of change presents a challenge to developers who want to stay abreast of the latest ideas and approaches. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/advanced-electronics/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-the-time-to-act-is-now"> McKinsey Global Institute's report on AI - the time to act is now</a>, is a must read.</p>
    <p>Conferences and other meetings provide opportunities to learn where the jobs and technology is headed and a chance to learn and practice the skills necessary to keep up. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) India Conference will be an annual event where leading AI researchers and top industry practitioners would meet and collaborate. The AI India Conference will bring together professionals of several industries that are currently being transformed by the recent breakthroughs of Artificial Intelligence. You will understand how to integrate AI practically into your workflows and work with the current tooling.</p>
    <p>Executives donâ€™t need (or want) a lesson in computer science, they want to know how this AI technology can be used as a tool to help them achieve their business goals.
